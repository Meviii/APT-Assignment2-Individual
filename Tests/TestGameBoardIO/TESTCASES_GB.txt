Running the tests:
========================
Run ./scrabble < ./Tests/TestGameBoardIO/<testname>.input > ./Tests/TestGameBoardIO/<testname>.output to make the output file.
diff -w ./Tests/TestGameBoardIO/<testname>.output ./Tests/TestGameBoardIO/<testname>.gameout to run the IO test.

The test Cases:
========================
newBoard tests a new GameBoard and its state upon starting a game. it is not possible to load a new board and due to the random element diff won't work correctly here
loadedBoard tests a loaded GameBoard and its updated state with added tiles.
