Running the tests:
========================
Run ./scrabble < ./Tests/TestMenuIO/<testname>.input > ./Tests/TestMenuIO/<testname>.output to make the output file.
diff -w ./Tests/TestMenuIO/<testname>.output ./Tests/TestMenuIO/<testname>.gameout to run the IO test.

The test Cases:
========================
loadValidFiles attempts to load a non-existant file, a file with filetype other than .sav, then loads a valid savefile
newGameNameValidity tests player name formating, allowed characters (letters), no duplicate names, and if a new game is started. diff won't work properly due to random nature of new games.
